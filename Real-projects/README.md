### How to Calculate the Margin of Safety
You compare:
- What you think the stock is really worth (called its Intrinsic Value)
- What the stock is selling for now (its Market Price)
Then you calculate how much cheaper the market price is compared to your estimated value.

#Simple Formula:

`Margin of Safety = (Intrinsic Value − Market Price)*100 / (Intrinsic Value)`
- MoS: Margin of Safety
- IV: Intrinsic Value
- MP: Market Price (i.e. current stock price)

#Benjamin Graham Formula
`Intrinsic Value=Earnings per Share ×(8.5+2×Expected Growth Rate)`

- IV: Intrinsic Value
- EPS: Earnings per Share
- EGR: Expected Growth Rate

#### Python program: Calculate the intrinsic value of a stock
- Initial implementation:  calculate_intrinsic_value
- Modify to add result to an output file
